# fake_news_detection

Today, We are going to create Fake News Detection using Machine Language

Nowadays, Fake News is a severe concerns for everyone. We can't identify the truth within hundreds of hundreds new articles in our daily life.

Although, It is a DEMO model which has less numbers of datasets. So,Here we will try to solve this issue of Fakes News with the help of machine learning in Python.

Before starting the code, First upload the dataset!

Then there are steps to be followed:

Importing Libraries and Datasets
Data Preprocessing
Preprocessing and analysis of News column
Converting text into Vectors
Model training, Evaluation, and Prediction
