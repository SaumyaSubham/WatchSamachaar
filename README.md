# news_watch

First of all, Welcome Everyone!
This is a project of Machine Learning and 
In this project, We are going to create a Fake News Detection model using Machine Language

Nowadays, Fake News is a severe concerns for everyone. We can't identify the truth within hundreds of hundreds new articles in our daily life.

Although, It is a DEMO model which has less numbers of articles in the datasets. So,Here we will try to solve this issue of Fakes News with the help of machine learning in Python.

Before starting the code, First upload the dataset!

Then there are steps to be followed:

1. Importing Libraries and Datasets
2. Data Preprocessing
3. Preprocessing and analysis of News column
4. Converting text into Vectors
5. Model training, Evaluation, and Prediction
